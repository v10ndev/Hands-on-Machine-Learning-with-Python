# About this book
This material has been created by Jake VanderPlas in the frame of the [Python Data Science Handbook](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook).

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks introducing beginners to the field of machine learning. This chapter will dive into practical aspects of machine learning, primarily using
Pythonâ€™s Scikit-Learn package

See part1 [Numpy-Pandas-Matplotlib](https://github.com/v10ndev/Intro-to-Numpy-Pandas-Matplotlib)
